# GSoC2026 Practice Repo
📌 Overview

This repository contains my structured preparation for Google Summer of Code 2026, focusing on Machine Learning, Open Source Contribution, and Python fundamentals.

I am following a weekly learning roadmap that covers:

Python OOP

Git & GitHub workflow

Linear Algebra for ML

Probability & Statistics

ML Algorithms from scratch

Model Implementation & Optimization

Open-source contribution skills

This repo includes daily practice code, assignments, and implementations of fundamental ML concepts written from scratch without libraries.

📅 Weekly Plan Overview
✔️ Week 1 — Foundations

Git & GitHub setup

Python OOP

Searching “good first issues”

Linear Algebra basics

✔️ Week 2 — Math for ML

Vectors & Matrices

Dot product, matrix multiplication

Projections, orthogonality

Probability theory

Covariance & Correlation

🚧 Week 3 — Machine Learning Basics

Linear Regression (from scratch)

Gradient Descent

Logistic Regression

Loss functions

Train/test split

🔜 Week 4 onwards

ML projects

Contributing to open-source ML repos
